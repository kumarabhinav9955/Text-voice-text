# Text-to-Voice and Voice-to-Text Converter

This project is a simple Text-to-Voice and Voice-to-Text converter built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application uses the Web Speech API's Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis features to provide voice-based interaction.

- **Voice-to-Text:** Converts spoken words into text.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition:** Allows users to speak and converts speech to text using the Speech Recognition API.
- **Speech Synthesis:** Converts written text to speech using the Speech Synthesis API.
- **Simple User Interface:** A minimal, easy-to-use interface built with HTML and styled using CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For the logic, including Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis.
- **HTML**: To structure the web page.
- **CSS**: For basic styling and layout.
- **Speech Recognition API**: To listen and transcribe speech into text.
- **Speech Synthesis API**: To convert text into speech.

## Usage

### Voice-to-Text (Speech Recognition)

2. Speak into the microphone.
3. The app will transcribe your speech into text in real-time.

### Text-to-Voice (Speech Synthesis)
1. Type text into the text input field.
2. Click the "Speak Text" button to hear the text read aloud.

## Example

```html
<input type="text" id="textInput" placeholder="Type text here...">
<button onclick="speakText()">Speak Text</button>

<button onclick="startListening()">Start Listening</button>
<p id="result">Your transcribed text will appear here.</p>
```

```javascript
// Speech Recognition (Voice to Text)
const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();
recognition.lang = 'en-US';
recognition.continuous = false;

recognition.onresult = function(event) {
  const transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript;
  document.getElementById('result').textContent = transcript;
};

// Start listening for speech
function startListening() {
  recognition.start();
}

// Speech Synthesis (Text to Voice)
function speakText() {
  const text = document.getElementById('textInput').value;
  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
  window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
}
```
